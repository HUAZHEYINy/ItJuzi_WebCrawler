# ItJuzi_WebCrawler
Repository of Web Crawler Project


<H1>OverView</h1>

I am extremly interested in the start up companies. So that, I implemented a web crawler that can crawler the start up companies info
and also some critical information including pre-IPO status and so on. Furthermore, I used several tools to virtualize these info that
we can extract some new info through the chart or graph from it.

<br>
This project is a web crawler project based on Scrapy Framework. 
Using MySQL Database to store the crawled data and also using three data virtualization tools to virtualize part of information.

</br>
Language: Python - 2.7</br>
DB: MySQL</br>
Virtualization Tools: D3.js - javascript; Plotly - Python; Tagexdo.
